# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the Flickr scraper project! This tool is designed to facilitate the acquisition of image data for machine learning tasks, specifically for those working with YOLO (You Only Look Once) models. By using simple search criteria provided by the user, it can quickly gather images from Flickr, streamlining the process of dataset creation for computer vision projects.

# üìã Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. Additionally, the necessary Python packages can be installed by running:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Among these, `flickrapi` is essential for accessing the Flickr API.

# üîß Installation

To set up the Flickr scraper on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/flickr_scraper
cd flickr_scraper
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

# üö¶ Getting Started

Here's how to get your scraper up and running:

### 1. Obtain a Flickr API Key
First, request an API key from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply).

### 2. Set Your API Credentials
Enter your API key and secret into `flickr_scraper.py` at the designated lines:

```python
# Enter your API key and secret here
key = 'YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY'
secret = 'YOUR_FLICKR_API_SECRET'
```

### 3. Run the Scraper
To search for images and optionally download them, you can execute the following command. Downloaded images will be stored in `flickr_scraper/images`, and please bear in mind that image downloads are constrained by Flickr's rate limits and policies.

```bash
python3 flickr_scraper.py --search 'honeybees on flowers' --n 10 --download
```

Example output showing image URLs (and image download if selected):
```
0/10 https://live.staticflickr.com/21/38596887_40df118fd9_o.jpg
...
9/10 https://live.staticflickr.com/1770/43276172331_e779b8c161_o.jpg
Done. (4.1s)
All images saved to /path/to/flickr_scraper/images/honeybees_on_flowers/
```
